> Just got out of Marked Men. Whew, my head's still spinning like a carousel on coffee. You know when you eat too much popcorn and it feels like there's a whole field inside you? Yeah, jacket’s still got breadcrumbs from those sticky caramel popcorn they sell at that new theater, my back’s protesting loudly - those seats should come with a chiropractor appointment.

Anyway, the movie… I'm telling you, it was like a chimera, you know those mythical beasts — half lion, half goat. But in film form. Stellar opening scene, so much smoke — think humid jungle mornings but trapped in a bullet storm. There were elephants in my mind for a second, jostling, making space for the explosions. Boom boom, and then quiet. That contrast. Life's sometimes like that, isn't it? 

Did you know someone once told me you could download the movie before the premiere? Wild. Oh, and, remember when the guy with the scar on his face just turns and suddenly there's lilting music? Like a lullaby gone off-key. Just like in those bird mating rituals where suddenly the wrong bird gets all the attention. 

It’s raw, like nature documentaries but with those bizarrely human emotions. How did they even manage to make betrayal smell? The scent of two ferns wrestling in the rain. Wait, did you ask if I’d watch the movie again? Maybe, if I could untangle that mess of visuals and feelings… although maybe without the sugar rush. 

Oh, did I mention the bit with the glass? Shattering everywhere, like a snowstorm of dangerous beauty. I remember reading about how some animals thrive in chaos. Maybe chaos breeds clarity… or awkward metaphors, who knows. 

I'm still thrilled, still disoriented! Definitely need to walk and digest – both in mind and stomach. Like after watching birds flock and scatter when a branch snaps – they know something I don't. So vivid, so loud.
